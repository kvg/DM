NAME
    DistributedMake::base - A perl module for running pipelines

VERSION
    0.1.002

SYNOPSIS
    todo

GOOD PRACTICE
    - Never make a directory a dependency. make creates directories as it
    needs them. - Never create rules that delete files. Delete files by hand
    instead. Chances are, You'll be sorry otherwise. - make runs in dryRun
    mode by default (this is for your own safety!). Pass in 'dryRun => 0' to
    new() to run.
